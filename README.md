# Simple Ruby IRC bot
This is a simple ruby IRC bot I made to learn ruby. It doesn't do much right now except show help and list all loaded "module" but it can be extended by writing modules for it.

## How to run
Change the ``` server ```, ``` port ```, ``` channel ``` and ``` nick ``` in ``` main.rb ``` then run ``` main.rb ```.
